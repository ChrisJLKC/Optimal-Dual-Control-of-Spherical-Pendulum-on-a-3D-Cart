# Optimal-Dual-Control-of-Spherical-Pendulum-on-a-3D-Cart
Describing the behaviour of a spherical pendulum on a 3D positional cart can be rather chaotic and not controllable in all degrees of freedom. 
In this repository, we have taken a new approach to how to control this system, on which splits the system into two control systems. This allows
the overall system to be monitored like a traditional pendulum on a cart in 2D space, but are multiplied together to produce a 3D system, on which
this repository dictates.
